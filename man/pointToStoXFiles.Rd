Get these by get("StoX_data_sources", envir=get("RstoxEnv"))). These could be given as directories, in which case all files in those directories are copied, or as URLs. If given as a single path to a directory holding sub-directories with names "acoustic", "biotic", "landing", "process" or other implemented types of data, the files are copied from these directories. If files has length 0 (default), the files present in the project directory are used, if already existing (requires to answer "y" when asked to overwrite the project if ow=NULL, or alternatively to set ow=TRUE).}
