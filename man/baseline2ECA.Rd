\arguments{
\item{projectName}{The name or full path of the project, a baseline object (as returned from \code{\link{getBaseline}} or \code{\link{runBaseline}}, og a project object (as returned from \code{\link{openProject}}).}

\item{biotic}{The process from which the biotic data are extracted, conventionally the BioticCovData process.}

\item{landing}{The process from which the landing data are extracted, conventionally the LandingCovData process.}

\item{temporal}{Optional definition of the temporal covariate (not yet implemented).}

\item{spatial}{Optional definition of the spatial covariate (not yet implemented).}

\item{landingresolution}{The temporal resolution in days to use for aggregating the landing data.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to \code{\link{getBaseline}}.}
}
\value{
A reference to the StoX Java baseline object

\description{
This function reads data from a baseline run and converts to a list of data used by the ECA model in the Reca package.
