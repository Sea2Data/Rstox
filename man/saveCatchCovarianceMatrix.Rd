\title{Save catch at age variance-covariance matrix for age groups}
\usage{
saveCatchCovarianceMatrix(pred, filename, var = "Abundance",
  unit = "ones", main = "", standardize = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred}{as returned by \code{\link[eca]{eca.predict}}}

\item{filename}{name of file to save to.}

\item{var}{Variable to extract for covariance calculation. Allows for Abundance, Count or Weight}

\item{unit}{Unit for extracted variable. See \code{\link{getPlottingUnit}}}

\item{main}{Title for the analysis, to be included as comment in saved file (e.g. species and year)}

\item{standardize}{If True, pearson correlations are calculated, rather than covariances.}
}
\description{
Write catch at age covariance predicted by \code{\link[eca]{eca.predict}} as csv file.
}
\details{
Covariance matrix is written as comma-separated file with quoted strings as row/column names.
   Each row and column correspond to an age group.
   Units for catch at age are controlled by parameters, and written as metainformation in a preamble identified by the comment charater '#', along with any text provided in other arguments (parameter main).
