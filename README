# Rstox version: 1.0 (latest beta, 2020-04-02)
# R version: 3.5


# The package Rstox contains most of the functionality of the stock assesment utility StoX, which is an open source application fo acoustic-trawl and swept-area survey estimation.


# Install the latest developer version
devtools::install_github("Sea2Data/Rstox")


# To do this, uncheck the box "32-bit Files" when selecting components to install.
# If you are re-installing an R that has both 32 and 64 bit, you will need to uninstall R first.

# On Windows systems with adminstrator requirements, it is recommended to install R in C:/users/<user>/documents/R.
# Also if you are using Rstudio, please make sure that you are using the correct R version (in case you have
# multiple versions installed). The R version can be selected in Tools > Global Options.

# Note that 64 bit Java is required to run Rstox

# On Windows, install Java from this webpage: https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp,
# or follow the instructions found on ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Tutorials/

# On Mac, getting Java and Rstox to communicate can be challenging.
# If you run into problems such as "Unsupported major.minor version ...", try the following:
# Update java, on
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# If this does not work install first the JDK and then the JRE:
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# Rstox sohuld also work with Java 11, presently available only as Development Kit:
# 	https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html
# You may want to check that the downloaded version is first in the list by running the following in the Terminal:
# 	/usr/libexec/java_home -V
# 	java -version
# Then run this in the Terminal.app (you will be asked for password, but the password will not show as you type.
# It is possible to type the password in a text editor first and then paste it into the Terminal.):
# 	sudo ln -s $(/usr/libexec/java_home)/jre/lib/server/libjvm.dylib /usr/local/lib
# 	sudo R CMD javareconf
# Open R (close and then open if already open) and install rJava:
# 	utils::install.packages('rJava', type='source')
# 	utils::install.packages('rJava', type="binary")
# If this fails, try installing from source instead using utils::install.packages('rJava', type='source')
# Then the installed Rstox should work.
