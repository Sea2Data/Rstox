# Rstox version: 1.11.1 (latest alpha, 2019-04-09)
# R version: 3.5

# The package Rstox contains most of the functionality of the stock assesment utility StoX, which is an open source approach to acoustic and swept area survey calculations. Download Rstox from ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox or install by running the following commands in R:

# Install the packages that Rstox depends on. Note that this updates all the specified packages to the latest (binary) version:
dep.pck <- c("data.table", "ggplot2", "pbapply", "rgdal", "rgeos", "rJava", "sp", "XML")
install.packages(dep.pck, repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org", type="binary")

# Install Rstox:
install.packages("ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox/Versions/Alpha/Rstox_1.11.1/Rstox_1.11.1.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

# Alternatively, install the latest development version from GitHub.
# Note that this does not guarantee a stable version.
# For official versions of Rstox, refer to the ftp server ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Download/Rstox/Versions/Alpha/Rstox_1.11.1 as described above.
# Install from github using the devtools package:
# devtools::install_github("Sea2Data/Rstox", ref="develop")

# R should be installed as the 64 bit version. On Windows 10, ONLY the 64 bit version should be used.
# To do this, uncheck the box "32-bit Files" when selecting components to install.
# If you are re-installing an R that has both 32 and 64 bit, you will need to uninstall R first.

# On Windows systems with adminstrator requirements, it is recommended to install R in C:/users/<user>/documents/R.
# Also if you are using Rstudio, please make sure that you are using the correct R version (in case you have
# multiple versions installed). The R version can be selected in Tools > Global Options.

# Note that 64 bit Java is required to run Rstox

# On Windows, install Java from this webpage: https://www.java.com/en/download/windows-64bit.jsp,
# or follow the instructions found on ftp://ftp.imr.no/StoX/Tutorials/

# On Mac, getting Java and Rstox to communicate can be challenging.
# If you run into problems such as "Unsupported major.minor version ...", try the following:
# Update java, on
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# If this does not work install first the JDK and then the JRE:
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
# 	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html
# Rstox sohuld also work with Java 11, presently available only as Development Kit:
# 	https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html
# You may want to check that the downloaded version is first in the list by running the following in the Terminal:
# 	/usr/libexec/java_home -V
# 	java -version
# Then run this in the Terminal.app (you will be asked for password, but the password will not show as you type.
# It is possible to type the password in a text editor first and then paste it into the Terminal.):
# 	sudo ln -s $(/usr/libexec/java_home)/jre/lib/server/libjvm.dylib /usr/local/lib
# 	sudo R CMD javareconf
# Open R (close and then open if already open) and install rJava:
# 	install.packages('rJava', type="binary")
# If this fails, try installing from source instead using install.packages('rJava', type='source')
# Then the installed Rstox should work.


# Release notes Rstox_1.11.1:

# 1. Added the option ref=NULL in aggregateBySpeciesCategory(), allowing for no reference file for grouping species into catecories.

# 2. Added the option of merging strata by specifying the parameter 'strata' as a list. The other parameters need to be given for the merged strata, so that if three strata are merged the hours/nmi of these should be summed to obtain similar effort as in the unmerged strata.

# 3. Fixed bug in plotAbundance() when there is only one non-NA level of either 'grp1' or 'grp2'.

# 4. Added the function plotFishStation() (and supporting funcitons) to plot the stations of a StoX project by species, possibly in different colors.
